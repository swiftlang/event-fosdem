## Notes for future organizers: 
- day of operations folks, especially those in production roles, need access to the devroom dasboard with the video and mic toggles
- include in cfp that there is a chance of only on mic so that could be hard for co-presenters
- chocolate and snacks rock!
- add a table inside of the room for swag

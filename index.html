        <h2>What is FOSDEM?</h2>
        <p>
            FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. 
            It provides open source software communities with a place to:

        <ul>
            <li>get in touch with other developers and projects;</li>
            <li>be informed about the latest developments in the free software world;</li>
            <li>be informed about the latest developments in the open source world;</li>
            <li>attend interesting talks and presentations on various topics by project leaders and committers;</li>
            <li>promote the development and benefits of free software and open source solutions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What are Developer Rooms?</h3>
        <p>
            It is important for free and open source software developers around the world to be able to meet in
            “real life”.
        </p>
        <p>
            DevRooms are a place for teams to discuss, hack and publicly present latest directions, lightning talks,
            news and discussions. The Swift DevRoom will have some structured presentations and lightning talks; however
            we also expect it to be a place for informal discussions.

            We are excited for Swift to host a DevRoom where contributors can exchange ideas with other open source projects.

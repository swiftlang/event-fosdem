                            <p>The design of Swift's type checker is somewhat unusual among programming languages,
                                because it combines constraint solving with type-based overloading. This allows for
                                expressive API design, but it also introduces some challenges with performance and
                                diagnostics. As is well-known, in the worst case, this kind of constraint system problem
                                takes exponential time to solve. On the other hand, there is much one can do to improve
                                performance on "realistic" inputs. In this talk, I will discuss the design of Swift's
                                constraint solver, outline some recent improvements made in Swift 6.3, and talk
                                about the roadmap for future improvements.</p>

                            <p>If your SwiftLint configuration hasn't changed in a while, you may be missing out.
                                SwiftLint evolves with the Swift language. New rules are regularly added, but they're
                                easy to overlook because they're usually disabled by default. This talk highlights
                                recently introduced or lesser-known SwiftLint rules, explains the problems they aim to
                                solve, and shows practical examples of when to enable/disable them. Understand why false
                                positives are sometimes unavoidable and learn how to keep your configuration up to date
                                and concise at the same time.</p>

                            <p>Danny's main interests revolve around language tools and developer experience. While he
                                does not work with Swift professionally, he maintains SwiftLint in his spare time. He
                                really enjoys open source, especially the amazing work done in the Swift community.
                                Working on SwiftLint is his contribution to the realm of free and open software that we
                                all benefit from every day.</p>

                            <h4>Abstract</h4>
                            <p>During my Internship at Swift for Arduino (S4A), I worked on two pieces of software,
                                CoreAVR and ArduinoKit, that enable people interested in using Swift on their Arduino
                                boards to do so in an easy-to-understand way.</p>
                            <p>CoreAVR is a Hardware Abstraction Layer for AVR microcontrollers written in Swift. It
                                abstracts low-level register operations into intuitive, type-safe APIs, offering a
                                modern alternative to tradition C-based libraries. Additionally, CoreAVR offers built-in
                                support for Interrupts, IO, Timer/Counter functionality with PWM, SPI, UART, and more,
                                making hardware interactions safer and easier to read and understand.</p>
                            <p>Building on CoreAVR, ArduinoKit acts as the Arduino standard library for S4A, fully
                                exposing the underlying features of CoreAVR, but adding higher-level functionality, such
                                as easy-to-use Digital and Analog IO, Timing functions (delay, millis, …), Serial
                                communication, and more. ArduinoKit additionally has a dual architecture, allowing both
                                modern Swift-like APIs to be used, as well as older Arduino-style functions, to ease
                                migration for users originally coming from Arduino.</p>
                            <p>This talk will serve as an introduction to both pieces of software, where a general
                                overview will be given, as well as code comparisons with their C-based counterparts.</p>

                            <p>Swift is found in many places - from tiny devices to large server applications - where it
                                delivers modern ergonomics, strong safety guarantees, and excellent performance. Web
                                frontend development, however, is still largely centered around JavaScript, with very
                                little Swift in sight.</p>
                            <p>With WebAssembly support firming up and Embedded Swift enabling tiny binaries, running
                                Swift in the browser is evolving from a complicated endeavor into a viable option.</p>
                            <p>In this session, we get to know the new open-source project ElementaryUI: a Swift
                                frontend framework for building web applications. It brings Swift's safety and
                                expressiveness to the frontend, allowing developers to describe state-driven user
                                interfaces using an idiomatic, SwiftUI-inspired syntax while remaining firmly a web
                                framework.</p>
                            <p>The talk covers the essentials to go from zero to "Swift in the Browser": setting up a
                                dev environment, composing views into a web UI, handling user inputs and events, and
                                transitions and animations. A live-coding session will showcase the framework's features
                                in action, leveraging hot-reloading for rapid iteration, before we conclude with a brief
                                look at the road ahead.</p>
                            <p>Whether you are an iOS developer looking to branch out or a web enthusiast seeking a
                                safer alternative to JavaScript, this talk offers a practical entry point. It is time to
                                make Swift in the browser happen!</p>

                            <p>Simon has spent long enough in software to know that creating a new web framework is a
                                bad idea — and did it anyway. After falling for Swift on the server, he accidentally
                                tumbled into the Swift + WebAssembly universe and decided to stay. As a father of two
                                based in Austria, he is currently juggling running a business, shipping code, bedtime

                            <p>Swift supports more platforms than ever, yet Swift app developers are stuck targeting
                                Apple platforms. SwiftCrossUI changes everything by bringing SwiftUI to Android, Linux,
                                and Windows, using native UI components on each platform. First we'll cover the basics
                                of SwiftCrossUI. Then we'll look at Swift Bundler which is the recommended way to ship
                                SwiftCrossUI apps to multiple platforms. And finally, we'll demo SwiftCrossUI's hot
                                reloading support. You'll come away from this session with the basic knowledge required
                                to develop apps for Apple platforms, Windows, Linux, and Android, all without leaving
                                the comfort of Swift.</p>

                            <p>Swift has rapidly grown beyond its origins on Apple platforms, becoming a powerful
                                language for systems programming, server-side development, and cross-platform
                                applications. Over the past few years, steady progress in tooling, language portability,
                                and community experimentation has made it increasingly viable to use Swift for Android
                                application development, culminating with the formation of the Swift Android workgroup
                                in 2025 and the release of the Swift SDK for Android. This talk explores the current
                                state of Swift on Android, focusing on what is practical today, what teams are already
                                shipping, and how the ecosystem may evolve in the coming years.</p>
                            <p>We will begin with an overview of how Swift code can be compiled and executed on Android,
                                including the role of the Swift toolchain, cross-compilation SDKs, and interaction with
                                the Android runtime. From there, the talk will dive into integration with the Android
                                SDK, covering common patterns for calling Java and Kotlin APIs from Swift, bridging via
                                JNI, and leveraging existing Android libraries without rewriting entire stacks.</p>
                            <p>User interface strategies will be discussed, comparing approaches such as using Kotlin or
                                Java Android UI frameworks (Views and Jetpack Compose) alongside Swift-based business
                                logic, as well as other solutions for higher-level UI abstraction. Particular attention
                                will be given to real-world tradeoffs in performance, developer experience, and
                                maintainability.</p>
                            <p>Finally, the talk will address the challenges of tooling interoperability, examining how
                                Swift Package Manager can coexist with Gradle and Android Studio, and what smoother
                                workflows might look like in the future. Attendees will leave with a clear picture of
                                what is possible today, where the rough edges remain, and how Swift is maturing into a
                                first-class cross-platform option for creating universal apps from a single
                                codebase.</p>

                            <p>At Frameo we distribute multiple Android apps and an iOS app to over 20 million users.
                                Traditionally, sharing core features meant maintaining separate Swift and Java
                                implementations, doubling the effort and the potential for bugs. With the recent
                                advancements in the swift-java project and the official Swift Android SDK, we are now
                                able to build cross-platform libraries in Swift with little effort, sharing core
                                functionality across our products. Not only does it save time and costs, but we are also
                                able to take advantage of Swift's performance, safety and the existing library
                                ecosystem!</p>
                            <p>In this talk we will go over what is new since the release of the JNI mode last summer.
                                We will cover how these new additions allows us to generate idiomatic Java libraries for
                                our Android developers, while preserving Swift's core features such as protocols and
                                Swift Concurrency.</p>
                            <p>We will walk through a feature we wanted to build in the Frameo software and how we wrote
                                a Swift package for end-to-end encrypted communication. We demonstrate how little effort
                                it takes to wrap that package using the swift-java JNI mode and compile it using the
                                Android SDK, such that we have a cross-platform library we can use on both iOS and
                                Android.</p>

                            <p>Password hashing in Vapor has relied on C code for years because pure Swift
                                implementations of Bcrypt were unusably slow in debug builds—taking tens of seconds
                                where C took milliseconds. This forces a critical part of our ecosystem to depend on
                                foreign code.</p>
                            <p>While bcrypt is a simple algorithm, it comes with a computationally heavy setup that
                                tanks debug performance when using unoptimised code. The latest versions of Swift offer
                                new tools to address this, but can they actually close the gap?</p>
                            <p>This talk chronicles my attempt to rewrite bcrypt in pure Swift and match C's debug
                                performance. I'll share what I learned exploring different approaches: from unsafe
                                pointers to Swift 6's new Span type. There will be real benchmarks showing what worked,
                                what didn't and why, and we'll examine the tradeoffs between performance, safety, and
                                ergonomics of each approach.</p>

                            <h4>Abstract</h4>
                            <p>As teams and organizations scale, managing secrets securely becomes a critical challenge.
                                How do you prevent credential sprawl? How do you audit access, both human and machine?
                                And how do you respond quickly when secrets leak? Fortunately, tools like OpenBao and
                                Hashicorp Vault offer well tested solutions to these problems, but integrating them
                                natively into Swift applications seems to be missing.</p>
                            <p>In this talk, we'll introduce VaultCourier, a Swift package that can access both OpenBao
                                and Hashicorp Vault. We'll discuss how to build Swift clients for large third-party APIs
                                using swift-openapi and Pkl, using the development of VaultCourier as an example.</p>
                            <h4>Speaker Bio</h4>
                            <p>I'm a Swift developer based in Munich, working at Quartett mobile. Driven by curiosity, I
                                joined the Swift Mentorship Program in 2022 and have contributed to the Swift Package
                                Index. I enjoy exploring Swift across different types of projects, with a particular
                                passion for server-side development. Before fully transitioning into software
                                engineering, I spent time in the world of Mathematics and Physics. I enjoy nature,
                                sports, and dancing.</p>
